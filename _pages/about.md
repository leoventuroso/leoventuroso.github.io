Data Scientist and Cognitive Neuroscientist

I am presently employed as a Data Scientist at Fraunhofer Italia. I recently graduated in Data Science at University of Trento in 2023 with a summa cum laude distinction and a score of 110. Trained before as neuroscientist, I am now working as Data Scientist in the Sustainable Innovation team at Fraunhofer Italia.

I specialize in Machine Learning and Computer Vision applications for Flexible Production Systems.

In my spare time I love to read, write and climb. I occasionally carve wood and make mugo schnapps.
