Data Scientist and Software Developer.

Data Science - MsC Student in the Digital Commons Lab. Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy
Trained as neuroscientist, I am now working as software developer and data scientist in the RD unit at AlmaViva Spa.

Specifically, I'm working in a remote rehabilitation project involving eye-tracking technology.
While in FBK my current thesis project focuses on designing and implementing a geospatial analysis tool for sustainable mobility and traffic stress related assessment.

In my spare time I love to read, write and climb (both boulder and lead). I occasionally carve wood and make mugo schnapps.
